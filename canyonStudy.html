          <dt>WHO'S WHISPERING CANYONS?</dt>
            <dd>Whispering Canyons Foundation LLC (WCF) is a small local non-profit located in the high mountain valley of Logan Utah. They 
              help underprivileged teen girls rise above their challenges. Their equestrian personal development program helps these special girls
              learn to have courage, be self-loving, confident with a bright future to look forward to.
            </dd>
          <dt>THE CHALLENGE</dt>
            <dd>Whispering Canyons needed help. They needed a way to get people to want to be part of their 
              organization. If the project was not successful they had plans to downsize and possibly close the non-profit because of 
              lack of donations and public interest. They needed ways to get their brand out to the community and show their
              vision of helping teen girls overcome life's challenges through the love of horses. 
            </dd>
          <dt>PROJECT GOAL</dt>
            <dd> Re-design the website with the main goal of getting people to want to participate and help at Whispering Canyons, create brand
            recognition, and build public awareness in the local community and surrounding area. </dd>
          <dt>WHAT ARE THE MAJOR IMPACTS OF THE PROJECT?</dt>
            <dd>Whispering Canyons was in discussion with its board members to greatly downsize due to lack of monatary and item donations, 
              lack of volunteers, public interest, and participants. Because of the success of the project, public interest, volunteers, 
              participants, and funding grew and has been maintained since the re-designing. monatary donations have increased $65,000+ a 
              year (an 400% increase), item donations increased 300%, horses and participants increased 200%, volunteers increased 300%, 
              and website traffic went from 54 visits per month to 1400+ visits per month.

          <div class="row" style="margin-top: 6em;">       
            <p>Whispering Canyons had a great vision.  They wanted to help underprivileged girls rise above their challenges 
              and through the equestrian personal development program become courageous, self-loving, confident girls with a 
              bright future to look forward to.  But Whispering Canyons could not fulfill their full dream because of funding 
              and donation relapses.  Whispering Canyons could not get bigger.  They could only help 6 girls at a time, even 
              then causing financial strain at times.  They needed to expand but most of their fundraiser and events had produced 
              small monetary results; not enough to expand, only to maintain.  During this struggle, the owner, a 76-year-old gentleman, 
              was diagnosed with macular degeneration and had 15 years before his eyesight was completely lost.  Whispering Canyons 
              had very few choices: shut down, maintain what was already developed, or immediately do what was needed to expand and 
              make the dream a reality.  They chose to make the dream a reality, but how?  
            </p>
              
            <p>I became a volunteer at Whispering Canyons because my daughter wanted to feed horses. I was 
              getting my degree in Web Development with an emphasis in User Experience and User Interface Design with a minor in graphic design.  I knew I 
              could help with more than just feedings and soon became their board member over tech, fundraisers, and the UI/UX re-designing of Whispering Canyon. 
              Honestly their website was the worst I had ever seen.  Their landing page consisted of an image of the backend of a horse, a color 
              scheme that did not send the message needed for public participation, and lots and lots of text with many grammar and spelling errors. 
              There was no reference to events, parades, etc. and the images were literally laying sideways on the page with no reference to what and 
              where these images were from. The other issue with the website is it was not 508 compliant, which for the owner was going to pose an issue very quickly.
            </p> 

            <p>I discovered after interviewing volunteers and the owner, they had little to no brand presence let along brand recognition.
                Whispering Canyons did not participate in parades, fairs, and other events put on by the city, they had no social media presence, 
                they never reached out to businesses for sponsoring and donations, and they had no consistent logo, colors, and graphics 
                that defined them when seen.

                <p>After interviewing 20 different people around the area, I realized some important details.</p>
                <p><b>No Brand Recognition:</b> Over 90% of the interviewees did not know anything about Whispering Canyons. 
                Of those who had seen us by the highway, 95% did not come to the events or stop by because they did not 
                think the events and facilities were for the public. Of the people who did come to the event, 75% came 
                because they saw the balloons and thought they would inquire if the event was public or private.  They did 
                not participate in parades and other public events to create brand recognition.
                </p>
                
                <p><b>Wrong Demographic:</b> They had always focused all their fundraisers on the horse community. 
                  Posters for events were placed in only horse related locations such as feed and horse equipment stores.
                  Their fundraisers had great ideas such as $5 horse rides and $5 buggy rides but horse people 
                  had their own horses to ride and did not need to attend fundraisers to do so. This was not 
                  the demographic they should have been focused on.  
                </p>

                <p><b>Minimal Public Relations and Social Media Presence:</b> Users had no way of knowing 
                what events were happening at Whispering Canyons and what upcoming events were scheduled. There were no references 
                to the events on social media, online event sites, newspapers, or radios. Because WCF did not have a social
                media presence and because of the minimal public relations presence, the general public did not know the 
                amazing work Whispering Canyons was doing for teen girls.</p>

                <p>They needed to focus on people and families with children under the age of 12 years old.  They needed to start 
                  advertising in daycares, schools, children&apos;s retail stores, dentist offices, restaurants, etc. not at horse 
                  stores like Tractor Supply and Cal Ranch and not at horse events like the county fair and 4-H.  We needed 
                  to show the non-horse community we were here and they were invited with a focus on public relations. They needed a full website re-designing, a 
                  social media presence, brand recognition in the community, and a marketing presence with graphic design re-construction. 
                  I also discovered, because the area was relatively new to development, the city had assigned Whispering Canyons the wrong address 
                  which would take visitor two streets away from where our events were actually taking place.

                <h3><b>Website Re-designing:</b></h3>
                  <p>The website badly needed re-designing. The website image seen on every page was a horse&apos;s backend. The old colors
                  were maroon and brown which sent a nice rustic feel but we needed a the website to encourage growth and participation and send a message of 
                  fun and togetherness. Many of the gallery images were laying on their side and all of the icon images were
                  badly outdated. There was no pages for events, participants, social media, ways to donate, ways to volunteer, and a Special Thanks page to 
                  thank companies and individuals for donations and support.</p>

                  <h4>Design Choices:</h4>                 
                   <p>I wanted a website that reflected the atmosphere at Whispering Canyons. The website needed to show the vibrant energy
                    of the program and the girls but also show that Whispering Canyons was stable, trustworthy, and grounded. The website also needed to encourage 
                  viewers to participate by not just color changes but by showing the public what things were happening at Whispering Canyons and how they could be part 
                  of the program. We needed a part of the website that showed fun and a place to be refreshed: girls riding their horses, volunteers laughing as they did service projects, horses 
                  dressed in halloween costumes, etc. </p>

                <h4>Wireframes:</h4>
                  <p>The pages that needed to be created were events, participants, social media, ways to donate, ways to volunteer, and "Special Thanks".
                    These pages were personalize the website so the view could see how they could help and participate. These pages also would show the public that 
                    Whispering Canyons was part of the community which would encourage brand recognition.

                 <h4>Marketing & New Graphic Designs:</h4>
                  <p>There was little marketing concepts used prior to my influence at Whispering Canyons. 
                  New graphic designs were implemented that would show fun engaging events that would encourage the demographic
                  and audience to participate. They were designed specifically for families and each event was designed to have family
                  participation. Banners were designed that could be read at high speed because Whispering Canyons was located on a busy 
                  highway. The were designed with colors that quickly got the attention of drivers but simple enough to read.

          <h2>Deliverable Design </h2>
          <p>The finished design was well accepted by the owener and by the people who viewed the website. 
            The website went from 54 visits a month to 1400+ visits.  When the project started, the website was only getting 54 visits a month; the visits increased 
          to 1400+ a month. They had 8 horse/girl pairs when I started. When I left, they had 26 horse/girl pairs. Their donation 
          increased 300% and they had a $65,000 increase in donations each year. The money raised during fundraisers increased 7 times 
          and people started volunteering. Counselors, veterinarians, and teachers were just a few who offered their services free of charge,
